Graph Theory -- The Game

I'm driven by the idea of learning by doing, and applying this to graph theory. Nodes and edges are abstractions of time, distance and other concepts. As a framework, graph theory adds further abstraction between the student and intuition.

Video games digitally represent unreal concepts, yet are played as though they are real, concrete. We physically lean into unreal corners when driving, we are afraid and elated by game objects. I want to bring the concepts of graph theory to life by making them game-like objects and activities. I imagine two levels of use:
1. End users who 'play' the game to build intuition
2. Programmers who interact with or even rebuild the code to build deeper intuition

A caveat -- my interest is not in the kind of gamification that uses casino tactics to influence people's actions. It's more... open world.
